	"description": "# Angular Momentum Conservation\n\nThis simulation demonstrates the fundamental principle of conservation of angular momentum in circular motion. A particle orbits around a fixed central point, allowing us to explore the relationship between radius and angular velocity under the conservation of angular momentum.\n\n## Physical Principles\n\n### Angular Momentum\nAngular momentum ($L$) is a conserved quantity in any system where no external torques are applied. For rotational motion, it is defined as:\n\n$L = I\\omega$\n\nwhere:\n- $I$ is the moment of inertia\n- $\\omega$ is the angular velocity\n\n### Moment of Inertia\nFor a point mass rotating at a fixed radius, the moment of inertia ($I$) is given by:\n\n$I = mr^2$\n\nwhere:\n- $m$ is the mass of the rotating particle\n- $r$ is the radius of rotation\n\n### Conservation of Angular Momentum\nIn the absence of external torques, angular momentum is conserved:\n\n$L = I_1\\omega_1 = I_2\\omega_2$\n\nFor a point mass system, this means:\n\n$mr_1^2\\omega_1 = mr_2^2\\omega_2$\n\nWhich leads to:\n\n$\\omega_2 = \\omega_1(\\frac{r_1}{r_2})^2$\n\nThis equation shows the inverse square relationship between radius and angular velocity when angular momentum is conserved.\n\n## Experimental Variables\n\n### Independent Variables\n- Radius of rotation ($r$): Distance from the rotation axis\n- Initial angular velocity ($\\omega$): Rate of rotation\n\n### Dependent Variables\n- Final angular velocity (when radius is changed)\n- Final radius (when angular velocity is changed)\n- Angular momentum (remains constant)\n\n### Controlled Variables\n- Mass of the rotating particle\n- Absence of external forces and torques\n- Rigid constraint maintaining circular motion\n\n## Physical Analysis\n\n### Relationship Between Variables\n1. **Angular Momentum Conservation**\n   - As radius increases, angular velocity must decrease to maintain constant $L$\n   - The relationship follows: $\\omega \\propto \\frac{1}{r^2}$\n\n2. **Linear Velocity**\n   - Linear velocity is related to angular velocity by: $v = \\omega r$\n   - Substituting the conservation law:\n     $v = \\frac{L}{mr}$\n\n3. **Rotational Kinetic Energy**\n   - Given by: $E_{rot} = \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2$\n   - Changes with radius according to: $E_{rot} = \\frac{L^2}{2I}$\n\n## Observational Guide\n\n### Key Phenomena\n1. **Radius Increase**\n   - Angular velocity decreases quadratically\n   - Linear velocity changes proportionally to $\\frac{1}{r}$\n\n2. **Radius Decrease**\n   - Angular velocity increases quadratically\n   - Linear velocity changes proportionally to $\\frac{1}{r}$\n\n### Notable Observations\n- The relationship between $r$ and $\\omega$ is nonlinear\n- The product $mr^2\\omega$ remains constant throughout the motion\n- Energy is redistributed between linear and rotational components\n\n## Real-World Applications\n\n### Natural Phenomena\n1. **Astronomical Systems**\n   - Formation and evolution of solar systems\n   - Spiral galaxy dynamics\n   - Planetary orbital variations\n\n2. **Atmospheric Phenomena**\n   - Tornado formation and intensification\n   - Cyclonic weather patterns\n   - Atmospheric vortices\n\n### Human Applications\n1. **Sports and Dance**\n   - Figure skating spins\n   - Diving rotations\n   - Ballet pirouettes\n\n2. **Engineering**\n   - Satellite orientation control\n   - Gyroscopic stabilization\n   - Centrifuge operations\n\n## Educational Objectives\n\nThis simulation helps students:\n1. Understand the conservation of angular momentum\n2. Visualize the inverse square relationship between radius and angular velocity\n3. Explore the connections between linear and angular motion\n4. Develop intuition about rotational dynamics\n\n## Extended Investigations\n\n### Suggested Studies\n1. Analyze the relationship between angular momentum and energy conservation\n2. Investigate the role of mass in the system\n3. Study the transition between different radii of rotation\n4. Examine the limits of the physical system\n\n### Discussion Questions\n1. How does the system's total energy change with radius?\n2. What determines the maximum possible angular velocity?\n3. How would the motion change if friction were present?\n4. What role does the constraint force play in maintaining circular motion?",
