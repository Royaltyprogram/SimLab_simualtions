SimLab is an internet laboratory where anyone can freely add and share their desired simulations. It's a platform that helps make scientific and mathematical concepts easier to understand through interactive, visual demonstrations.

## 🌟 About SimLab

SimLab aims to:
- Provide interactive visualizations of scientific and mathematical concepts
- Make complex ideas more approachable through hands-on simulations
- Offer a platform where anyone can share their educational simulations
- Build a collection of high-quality, web-based learning tools

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Interactive Simulations**: Visual demonstrations of various scientific and mathematical concepts
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design that works across all devices
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate visual feedback for parameter adjustments
- **Contributor System**: Simple process for adding new simulations
- **Firebase Backend**: Reliable infrastructure for simulation management and analytics

## 👥 Contributing Simulations

Anyone can add new simulations to SimLab! Here's the process:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your simulation
3. Submit a Pull Request
4. After review and approval, it will be added to SimLab

### Simulation Requirements

Your simulation should:
- Be interactive and educational
- Work responsively across different screen sizes
- Include clear instructions and explanations
- Use React and follow our code style
- Be well-documented with comments

### Component Template
```jsx
const YourSimulation = () => {
  // Your simulation logic
  return (
    <div className="simulation-container">
      {/* Your simulation JSX */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default YourSimulation;
```
