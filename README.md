# SimLab: Simple Simulation Laboratory üß™

SimLab is a personal project that provides an interactive web platform for scientific and mathematical simulations. While this is a personal project, I welcome contributions from others who want to add their own simulations to help make complex concepts more accessible through visual, interactive demonstrations.

## üåü About SimLab

SimLab aims to:
- Provide interactive visualizations of scientific and mathematical concepts
- Make complex ideas more approachable through hands-on simulations
- Create a platform where contributors can share their own educational simulations
- Build a collection of high-quality, web-based learning tools

## üéØ Current Features

- **Interactive Simulations**: Visual demonstrations of various scientific and mathematical concepts
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design that works across all devices
- **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic parameter adjustments with immediate visual feedback
- **Contributor System**: Easy process for adding new simulations
- **Firebase Backend**: Reliable infrastructure for simulation management and analytics

## üë• Contributing Simulations

While SimLab is a personal project, I welcome contributions of new simulations! Here's how you can add your simulation:

1. Contact me at edulens43@gmail.com with your simulation idea
2. Once approved, fork the repository
3. Create your simulation following our template and guidelines
4. Submit a pull request

### Simulation Requirements

Your simulation should:
- Be interactive and educational
- Work responsively across different screen sizes
- Include clear instructions and explanations
- Use React and follow our code style
- Be well-documented with comments

### Component Template
```jsx
const YourSimulation = () => {
  // Your simulation logic here
  return (
    <div className="simulation-container">
      {/* Your simulation JSX */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default YourSimulation;
```

## üîß Technical Stack

- React for UI components
- Firebase for backend services (Firestore, Storage)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router for navigation
- Lucide Icons for UI elements
- KaTeX for mathematical expressions

## üìù Documentation Requirements

When submitting a simulation, please include:
- Description of the concept being demonstrated
- Clear user instructions
- Scientific/mathematical background
- Code comments explaining complex logic
- Any references or additional resources

## üìû Contact
